If the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation result is 0. Following the principle of "complete substitution, then reduction" expression (p) 
will never be executed.The result of the if-expression predicate will return #t - evaluating the consequence - 0.

If the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation result is infinity loop. This is the result we get when evaluating the arguments.
